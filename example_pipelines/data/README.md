articles on NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information).
It is a subset of `oa_comm`, open access allowed for commercial use.
The full set can be downloaded from [NCBI][ncbi_oa] directly.

The PM/PMC article data from NCBI is perfect fr NLP task.
It is a considerable amount of text that allows for naive NLP
as well as tokenisation and LLM experiments.
It is enough data to test partitioning and salting.
